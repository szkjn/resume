Hi all ! : : )

I'm Jun Suzuki 1/2-french, 1/2-japanese ex-opera singer, with a background in digital, sound and installation art, freshly graduated from Epitech Coding Academy Machine Learning & Data Analysis 2021 Course.

I'm currently looking for a **3 to 6 months internship** to consolidate my training in a challenging and collaborative work environment. I'm particularly looking for anything related to **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision.**

#### More about myself :

I've spent the last 3 years challenging myself, attending selective art residencies all around Europe (Iceland, Hungary, Germany, Georgia) learning new skills and technologies to enhance creative expression, crossing paths with people from different backgrounds and origins, soaking up in the diversity of experiences and perspectives the world provides. This ongoing learning slowly and surely brought out in me a **vivid interest in programming and machine learning**.

At some point, I remember telling myself (half-lost on an island at the edge of the world in Iceland) that for the first time I'd consider sound and images as **data that can be manipulated with algorithms**. That moment was the turning point from where everything changed.

After 10 months of self-teaching basic programming and statistics online, I enrolled in a high-standard course on Data Analysis and Machine Learning at the *Coding Academy by Epitech*, well known for its learn-by-doing pedagogy.

The most precious thing that I've been taught there is **to learn by myself, to gather all the knowledge that I need to make things work**. 

I'm well aware I'm still a beginner in this ecosystem but **I'm more than ever confident in my learning skills**. 

In addition, **my artistic background has provided me with many soft skills over the years** : 
+ creativity
+ openmindedness
+ tactfulness
+ team-spirit
+ self-reassessment
+ curiosity
+ know-how and determination to conduct a project from conception to delivery

Now that I've embarked on this journey, I'm determined to dig deeper.

So, if you're looking for an out-of-the-ordinary-ML-enthusiast-young-but-commited-Python-dev, 

hit me up : : )
