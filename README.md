### About me

Hi all,

I'm Jun Suzuki 1/2-french, 1/2-japanese ex-opera singer,
with a background in digital, sound and installation art
freshly graduated from Epitech Coding Academy
Machine Learning & Data Analysis 2021 course.

I'm currently looking for a **3 to 6 months internship** to consolidate my training in a challenging and collaborative work environment.

More about myself :

I've spent the last 3 years challenging myself, attending selective art residencies all around Europe (Iceland, Hungary, Germany, Georgia), learning new skills and technologies to enhance creative expression and better interact with the world. This ongoing learning slowly and surely brought out in me a vivid interest in programming and machine learning.

At some point, I remember telling myself that for the first time I'd consider sound and images as data that can be manipulated with algorithms. That moment was the turning point from where everything changed.

After 10 (covid) months of self-teaching basic programming and statistics online, I enrolled in a 5 months high-standard course on Data Analysis and Machine Learning at the Coding Academy by Epitech, well known for its learn-by-doing pedagogy.

The most precious thing that I've been taught there is to learn by myself, to gather all the knowledge that I need to make things work. I'm well aware I'm still a beginner in the Data Analysis ecosystem but I'm more than ever confident in my learning skills. Now that I've embarked on this journey, I'm curious to go further.

Life is short. There is much to learn.
